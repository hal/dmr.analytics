    //   descending.
    // Exercise: Try you own set of text files. First run Crawl5a to generate
    //   the "web crawl" data.
    // Exercise (hard): Try combining some of the processing steps or reordering
    //   steps to make it more efficient.
    // Exercise (hard): As written the output data has an important limitation 
    //   for use in a search engine. Really common words, like "a", "an", "the", 
    //   etc. are pervasive. There are two tools to improve this. One is to 
    //   filter out so-called "stop" words that aren't useful for the index.
    //   The second is to use a variation of this algorithm called "term 
    //   frequency-inverse document frequency" (TF-IDF). Look up this algorithm
    //   and implement it.
